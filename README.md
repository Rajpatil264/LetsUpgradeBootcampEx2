## Program Overview
**Filename:** `prime_number_check.cpp`

### Introduction
This program determines whether a given number is a prime number or not. It employs a simple loop-based approach to check the divisibility of the number by various integers.

### Algorithm
1. The program takes an input integer `num` from the user.
2. It initializes a variable `count` to keep track of the number of divisors.
3. The program iterates through all numbers from 1 to `num`, checking if `num` is divisible by each number.
4. If `num` is divisible by a number, the `count` is incremented.
5. After the loop, if `count` equals 2, it means that the number is only divisible by 1 and itself, making it a prime number.
6. If `count` is not equal to 2, the number is not prime.

### How to Use
1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the executable.
3. Enter an integer to be checked for primality.
4. The program will display whether the entered number is prime or not.

### Conclusion
This program provides a straightforward way to determine whether a given number is prime or not. It showcases the use of loops and conditional statements in C++.
